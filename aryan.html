                Fun Facts about Vertebrates The only mammals that lay eggs are monotremes such as the platypus and spiny anteater. There are reptiles that live on every continent except Antarctica. Most fish have skeletons made of bone, they are called bony fish.What are vertebrates? Vertebrates are animals that have a backbone or spinal column, also called vertebrae. These animals include fish, birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles. How are they classified? Vertebrates are classified by the chordate subphylum vertebrata. Invertebrates are any other animal that is classified outside of that class. Are there a lot of vertebrate species? There are currently around 65,000 known species of vertebrate animals. This sounds like a lot, but vertebrates are only around 3% of all the animals on Earth. Most of the animal species are invertebrates.Additional Facts. Invertebrates are ectotherms (cold-blooded): they warm their bodies by absorbing heat from their surroundings. Most invertebrates live in water or spend at least some part of their life in water. Some groups of invertebrates live on land. Common examples include worms, insects and spiders.
